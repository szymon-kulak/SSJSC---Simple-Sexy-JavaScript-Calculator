# SSJSC - Simple Sexy JavaScript Calculator

A quick JS Calculator I whipped out in a couple hours to practice what I've learned about JavaScript on real files.
This app is incredibly simple and does what it says on the tin - performs 5 basic calculations (*addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division* and *division remainder*) and throws out errors if the user hasn't provided either of the numbers or chosen calculation type.
